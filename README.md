# Media-Titles
Hey all!

This is a analysis software that adds onto the work done by the Facebook scraper:

https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper

This scraper pulls every post on a Facebook page with the number of likes, shares and comments.
The analysis completed in this script adds tons of both emotional and objective metrics to the collection and stratifies the titles in sets based on number of likes.

If you have comments, questions, or want to talk about something interesting, please contact:
